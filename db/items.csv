Himalayan Salt Plate/Holder,"This unique cookware is a creative and tasty way to use Himalayan Salt in your kitchen. For ease of use, this 8x12 salt plate comes packaged with a porcelain-coated steel salt plate holder. To heat, simply place in a cold oven, on the stove, on the grill or under the broiler. For all heating methods, let the salt plate come up to temperature slowly. If you wish, you can remove the Himalayan salt brick then cook on it, as it holds heat for a long time. The salt plate can be heated on the holder, making it easy to lift and remove the heated plate from the grill, stove, or oven. Care: To clean after use, scrub with a mildly abrasive brush. You may use a moist cloth as well. This removes a very thin layer of salt and makes it ready to be used again. Do not run under water or submerge. There is no need for any soaps or detergents of any kind. (No bacteria can grow on salt.) If you are not using it for a while, wrap it in plastic and store it in a dry place.

'Salt is the only rock directly consumed by man. It corrodes but preserves, desiccates but is wrested from the water. It has fascinated man for thousands of years not only as a substance he prized and was willing to labor to obtain, but also as a generator of poetic and mythic meaning. The contradictions it embodies only intensify its power and its links with experience of the sacred.'' -Margaret Visser
