Himalayan Salt Plate/Holder,"This unique cookware is a creative and tasty way to use Himalayan Salt in your kitchen. For ease of use, this 8x12 salt plate comes packaged with a porcelain-coated steel salt plate holder. To heat, simply place in a cold oven, on the stove, on the grill or under the broiler.

'Salt is the only rock directly consumed by man. It corrodes but preserves, desiccates but is wrested from the water. It has fascinated man for thousands of years not only as a substance he prized and was willing to labor to obtain, but also as a generator of poetic and mythic meaning. The contradictions it embodies only intensify its power and its links with experience of the sacred.'' -Margaret Visser
